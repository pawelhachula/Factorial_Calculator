## Project description
The project was created to teach practical testing and create test documentation. It consists of a test plan, bug reports and a test report. This is the first test plan and test report I've ever created. My assumption was to find as many bugs in the application as possible through exploratory testing and learning how to write documentation. Bug reports are presented in the form of screenshots from Jira, where I ran my project.


## About the app
Factorial Calculator is a simple web application presenting a program for calculating factorials, but the main purpose of creating the application is not mathematical activities, but conducting qualification processes with software testers and QA specialists. The application is used by recruiters in recruiting new employees.

This application was designed by Qxf2 Services.
